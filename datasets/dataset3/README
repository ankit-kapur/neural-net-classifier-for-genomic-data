In train.txt and test.txt, 
(1) Each column corresponds to one sample
(2) Each row corresponds to a numeric feature

There 7004 features, but only 70 samples in total.
We hold out the groudtruth for test.txt, which you need to generate.

This is a typical high-dimentional problems in biomedical research, 
where the number of features is far more than the number of samples.
Most machine learning algorithms cannot directly handle this problems well.
This is an open problems, and you can be creative and try your best to solve this real-world problem

GOOD LUCK!
